# CommunityBoard
A Java based program meant to run on a decentralized network to help support communal resources and activities

## Requirements
When running the Board executable, assuming you are the appointed Tech Administrator of the community, you must have two command line arguments:<br>
<blockquote>{directory to host the server on}
  <br>{user.properties file folder path}</blockquote>

If you are a user, not a Tech Administrator, the Main java file can be run with no command arguments to start up the BoardCLI.
